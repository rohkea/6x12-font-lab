6x12px-font-lab
===============

This project is for experimenting with EasyRPG Player's bitmap font.

The goal is to expand the 6x12/12x12 Shinonome font so that it will be usable
for more languages.

What is included in this project
--------------------------------

This project is envisioned as a set of tools to make working with
EasyRPG fonts easier.

Currently it only includes a visualizer to display symbols in some
fonts (for now, it's not optimized at all, so some operations take
time).

to have a better license.
